Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

Firstly, I created a calorie calculator, which estimates what how many calories one must eat per day based
on a few factors, such as their weight, height, etc. I am also beginning to store
variables for my upcoming questions in dictionaries, which will be collected in questions

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I've got quite some work to do. I must finish storing my items in dictionaries for upcoming questions.
I must also create functions embedded with while/if statements that
answers the questions. I also have to learn about the automation program, which will resend an email at
a certain time in Python. I'd say that I only am about 25% completed.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I was planning on using previous variables to estimate the amount
of protein/carbs/fats that one must need per day, but I'm still trying to find
websites that accomodate/calculate how these measurements are 
obtained. This means that this aspect may not be included. If I am able to find information,
then it would (hopefully). I will most likely encounter a few more problems 
as I dig deeper into the project.

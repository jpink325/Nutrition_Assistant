# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Achieve Your Macronutrient Goal Today with this Feature!

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Macronutrient Calculator Counter that Provides Recommendations based on A variety of variables
(Diet, location(Philadelphia Metropolitan Counties  Only), maximum weekly budget, allergies).
Based on these variables, a series of grocery stores, food types, etc will be provided, as well as daily automated emails about persevering


## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This project will be performed on Python, specifically using PyCharm.
Macronutrient Calculator Counter that Provides Recommendations based on
A variety of variables (Diet, location(Philadelphia Metropolitan Counties  Only)
maximum weekly budget, allergies). These recommendations would be which
 grocery store(s) to shop at, the types of foods to buy that contain the necessary
macronutrients you’re looking for (also giving specific ranges of how much 
ou should consume. For example, if you’re looking to consume a protein
friendly item that is not meat, the algorithm would recommend eggs or chickpeas.
If one has a tree nut allergy, it would not provide this recommendation. Also might make it more advanced
y automating a task that dims an email/text to the user to ensure 
hat they are following their goals at a specific time in a day. Probably at 10:00 AM



## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

NOT APPLICABLE

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

No matter what, I will be able to recommend where the user should should and AT LEAST 15 recommended products that they should be able to buy, based on how they answered in the questionaire.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

As a better outcome, I hope to not only recommend where one should shop, but there should be no errors (where I recommend a user with a dairy allergy with a dairy product)
. Another better outcome would to set up an automated email (Gmail)) at a certain time (using the time module in Python). Not only is the goal to
give good recommendations on macronutrients, but to also send an automated Gmail to ensure that the user perseveres
with their goal.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Before the project deadline, I hope to be able to give good recommendations for what the user is trying to consume and provide an automated message sent through Gmail 
that alerts the user to focus on their goal. If time is granted, I might also want to prompt a survey for the user through an automated message, in hopes to get their 
feedback on how everything went after 1 month of progress (Again, time...). The survey will ask questions like (Rate your satisfaction... What could be done better, etc..)

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

To complete this task, I'm firstly going to have to review the material that I learned in Python. Conditionals play
a HUGE role in this. Many of the questions I ask will go through a series of if and while statements. I will also have to
use my dictionary knowledge to have different types of sections in Python, which might or might not have overlapping
features for dietary preferences, etc. Next, I'm going to have to learn the time module on Python. I will also have to learn
about certain automated tasks on Python, such as the process of emailing someone through Gmail, which most likely uses imports to 
function. Lastly, if I'm going to be able to make a survey, I will have to learn how to conduct that, which most likely involves
a certain Python module. 

This project will most likely take an extremely long time, given the variables that
I will have to input, which will be tedious and difficult at times. I think the outcome will be 
worth it, as I'll be a Python expert.
